## [Point Cloud Visualizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/view3d_point_cloud_visualizer.py) (for blender 2.80)

Display colored point cloud PLY in Blender's 3d viewport. Works with binary point cloud PLY files with 'x, y, z, nx, ny, nz, red, green, blue' vertex values. Vertex normals and colors are optional. Color values must be in 0-255 range.

![Point Cloud Visualizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/pcv-0.6.5.png)

### General info

##### Usage:

* Install and activate addon in a usual way.
* Add any object type to scene.
* Go to 3d View Sidebar (N) > `Point Cloud Visualizer` panel, click file browser icon, select ply file, click `Load PLY`.
* Click `Draw` button to display point cloud, `Erase` to hide point cloud.
* Transforming parent object transforms point cloud as well.
* `Illumination` works only when vertex normals are present
* When vertex colors are missing, cloud will be displayed in uniform gray, in this case you can enable `Illumination` to have better cloud view

##### Display Options:

* `Display` - percentage of displayed points
* `Size` - point size in pixels
* `Illumination` - enable extra illumination, works only when vertex normals can be loaded.
* `Light Direction` - light direction
* `Light Intensity` - light intensity
* `Shadow Intensity` - shadow intensity

### Point cloud rendering

Currently only sigle point cloud per render/frame is supported. If you need more clouds at once, select another cloud parent and re-render with different suffix in `Render` subpanel. Output image is RGBA 8bit PNG - transparent background with colored point cloud, which can be composed over something else later.

##### Usage:

* Load and display ply first.
* Make a camera and adjust as needed.
* Set render image size in `Properties > Output > Dimensions`. Resolution X, Y and % are used.
* Set render path in `Properties > Output > Output`. Just path is used.
* Select cloud parent object, set point size with `Size` or percentage of rendered points with `Count`
* If `Illumination` is enabled it will be rendered as well
* Hit `Render` or `Animation`.

##### Render options:

* `Size` - point render size in pixels
* `Count` - percentage of rendered points
* `Suffix` - rendered image filename suffix. If filename in `Output` path is defined result filename will be `NAME_SUFFIX_######.png`, if only path is given, result is `SUFFIX_######.png`
* `Leading Zeros` - image filename frame number leading zeros count

##### Known bugs:

* If you duplicate object with cloud, duplicate will still control the original one until you load a different one. Currently there is no reliable way (as far as i know) to get unique id of an object and therefore no way to tell to which object stored properties (e.g. path to ply) belong.

## [Tube UV Unwrap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/uv_tube_unwrap.py) (for blender 2.80)

UV unwrap tube-like meshes (all quads, no caps, fixed number of vertices in each ring)

![Tube UV Unwrap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/tuv280.gif)

notes:

* Works only on tube-like parts of mesh defined by selection and active vertex (therefore you must be in vertex selection mode) and the selection must have a start and an end ring. Tube-like mesh is: all quads, no caps, fixed number of vertices in each ring. (Best example of such mesh is mesh circle extruded several times or beveled curve (not cyclic) converted to mesh.) There must be an active vertex on one of the boundary loops in selection. This active vertex define place where mesh will be 'cut' - where seam will be placed.
* Result is rectangular UV for easy texturing, scaled to fit square, horizontal and vertical distances between vertices are averaged and proportional to each other. 

usage:

1. tab to Edit mode
2. select part of mesh you want to unwrap, tube type explained above
3. make sure your selection has boundaries and there is an active vertex on one border of selection
4. hit "U" and select "Tube UV Unwrap"
5. optionally check/uncheck 'Mark Seams' or 'Flip' in operator properties

[BlenderArtist.org thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?339782-UV-Equalize-and-Tube-Unwrap-addons)

changelog:

* 0.3.0 blender 2.8 update

## [Fast Wavefront^2](https://github.com/uhlik/bpy/tree/master/io_mesh_fast_obj) (for blender 2.80)

**Import/Export single mesh as Wavefront OBJ. Fast. Now with Cython. Binaries not included.**

Only active mesh is exported. Only single mesh is expected on import. Supported obj features: UVs, normals, vertex colors using MRGB format (ZBrush) or 'Extended' format (import only) where vertex is defined as (x,y,z,r,g,b).

![Fast Wavefront^2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/obj2.png)

changelog:

* 0.3.2 import 'extended' vertex colors (x,y,z,r,g,b), optionally apply gamma correction
* 0.3.1 import obj (python only)
* 0.3.0 export implemented in cython
* 0.2.0 ported to blender 2.80

**requirements:**

* python 3.7.0 (the same as shipped with blender 2.8)
* Cython (easiest is to install with pip)

**installation on mac (win/linux should be very similar):**

1. download repository and copy whole directory `io_mesh_fast_obj` to `/Users/*USERNAME*/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.80/scripts/addons/`
2. in terminal cd to `/Users/*USERNAME*/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.80/scripts/addons/io_mesh_fast_obj/`
    1. `$ git clone http://git.blender.org/blender.git`
    2. `$ python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace`
3. now delete `blender` directory, it is no longer needed until blender is updated, then you (might) need to repeat the process

## [Import Agisoft PhotoScan Cameras](https://github.com/uhlik/bpy/tree/master/io_import_photoscan_cameras.py)

Import cameras from Agisoft PhotoScan xml. Works with xml version 1.4.0 which is exported from PhotoScan 1.4.x versions. If you want to have images actually aligned with model, undistort images first. This is done in PhotoScan by `Export > Undistort Photos..`. Because you can't in Blender set resolution for cameras independently, xml with different cameras or image resolutions might not work well.

![Import Agisoft PhotoScan Cameras](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/pscamerasui.png)

usage:

1. go to `Properties > Scene > Import Agisoft PhotoScan Cameras` panel
2. **Cameras XML**: set path to xml
3. set import options:
    * **Camera Display Size**: size of imported cameras in viewport
    * **Load Camera Images**: load images or not
    * **Images Directory**: path to directory with undistorted images
    * **Image Extension**: images extension, they all should be the same (currently)
    * **Alpha**: camera image alpha, 0.0 - 1.0
    * **Depth**: camera display depth, front / back
4. there are some more optional properties:
    * **Create Chunk Region Borders**
    * **Align to Active Object**: if you import mesh from PhotoScan first, the transform it to correct size and orientation, this option will copy transformation from that mesh if it is active
5. hit **Import**
6. import done..
7. now you can quickly swap cameras in alphabetical order in `PhotoScan Cameras Utilities` panel

[BlenderArtist.org thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/addon-import-agisoft-photoscan-cameras/1140610)

changelog:

* 0.1.1 first release

## [Carbon Tools](https://github.com/uhlik/bpy/tree/master/carbon_tools.py)

Ever-evolving set of small tools, workflows and shortcuts focused mainly on processing photogrammetry scans.

![Carbon Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/carbon_tools.png)

#### Subtools

* **Extract** selected part of mesh to a new object. If edges of extracted mesh are changed, it won't be able to merge back seamlessly - use option to hide edges (lock button) to protect them.
* **Insert** it back when finished editing.
* **Extract Non-Manifold** elements with part of mesh around them (10x expanded selection) as subtool

#### Dyntopo

* **Dyntopo Setup** - Quick setup for optimizing mesh resolution. Set desired **Constant Resolution** and **Method** and hit **Dyntopo Setup**
Mode is switched to Sculpt with Dyntopo, brush is set to strength 0 - affecting only mesh resolution.
* **Dyntopo Live Settings** - current settings which can be changed during sculpting

#### Texture Paint

* **Texture Paint Setup** - Quick setup for retouching texture in Photoshop, set **Resolution** of exported images and hit **TP Setup** (Photoshop must be set in preferences as Image Editor)
* **External TP Live Commands**: **Quick Edit** - export image and open in PS, **Apply** - project image back to model, **Save All Images** - save all edited textures

#### IO

* **Import from ZBrush** (depends on other addon Fast Wavefront^2)
* **Export to ZBrush** (depends on other addon Fast Wavefront^2)
* **Transformation: Selected > Active** - Copy transformation from selected to active. Useful for setting correct scale and orientation after initial import from PhotoScan.
* **Matrix: Selected > Active** - Select matrix source object first and then target object. Matrix will be copied while keeping visual transformation intact.
* **Export to PhotoScan** (depends on other addon Fast Wavefront^2)

#### End
* **End** ends current procedure: Dyntopo and Texture Paint back to Object mode and reset all settings

#### Utilities

* **Smooth** / **Flat** shading, just shortcuts
* **UV Coverage** calculate and print how much percent covers active uv layout
* **Seams From Islands** mark seams from UV islands
* **Select Seams** select seam edges
* **Seams > Wireframe** copy seams edges to a new mesh object
* **Export UV Layout**
* **Wireframe** set display to shaded + wire + all edges and deselect object
* **Select Non-Manifold** select non-manifold elements and optionally focus camera on them (eye icon)

#### Conversions

* **UVTex > VCols** - Copy image colors from active image texture node in active material using active UV layout to new vertex colors
* **Group > VCols** - Active vertex group to new vertex colors, vertex weight to rgba(weight, weight, weight, 1.0)
* **VCols > Group** - Active vertex colors to new vertex group, vertex weight by color perceived luminance
* **Difference > Group** - Calculate difference between two selected meshes and write as vertex group to active mesh. Selected is consedered to be original, active to be modified. Objects should have the same transformation.

changelog:

* 2.2.2 ui changes, mesh difference to group, calculate uv coverege
* 0.2.1 uvtex / vcols / group conversions
* 0.2.0 first release

## [Time Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/system_time_tracker.py) (for blender 2.80)

Simple time tracker inside blender. After you install and enable it, it will log loaded and saved files and time spent of file until it is saved. All ui is inside addon preferences.

![Time Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/tt2.png)

Here you can enable / disable logging, clear data collected so far, set custom data path (.csv) and see short summary of collected data and open individual project directories in file browser. The project name is determined by directory name where the blend is. For example if you have project in directory named "MyNewOutstandingProject" and all blends are inside subdirectory "models", set level number to 1 and you will see project name in results. 0 is directory directly above blend, 1 is one directory above blend, and so on. If you are like me and all your projects have the same subdirectory structure, sent directory level and you are good to go.

[BlenderArtist.org thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?345129-Time-Tracker-addon)

changelog:

* 0.2.0 updated for 2.80
* 0.1.0 added simple ui
* 0.0.8 ui tweaks, more advanced options, minor bugfixes
* 0.0.7 fixed performance and sorting, added tracking of files which were closed without saving once a minute (can be enabled in preferences: check Track Scene Update)
* 0.0.6 first release

## [OpenGL Lights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/2.7x/space_view3d_opengl_lights.py)

Simple and effective access to Solid OpenGL Lights for your viewport. Comes with clean, simple interface and endless possibilities. No more fiddling with preferences and other similar confusing, complex and view obscuring addons!

![OpenGL Lights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/gll2.gif)

[BlenderArtist.org thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?346612-The-most-efficient-OpenGL-Lights-panel-%28with-presets-system%29)

changelog:

## [Fast Wavefront](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/2.7x/io_mesh_fast_obj.py) (for blender 2.7x)

Import/Export single mesh as Wavefront OBJ.

Only active mesh is exported. Only single mesh is expected on import. Supported obj features: UVs, normals, shading, vertex colors using MRGB format (ZBrush) or so called 'extended' format when each vertex is defined by 6 values (x, y, z, r, g, b). Export is ~3x faster than built-in obj exporter and import ~2x. It lacks some features, but saves quite a bit time when you need to move high resolution mesh from blender to ZBrush and back a few times per hour while cleaning up scans.

Comes with a few presets (created upon activation) for following workflow: import raw mesh obj from Agisoft PhotoScan, export raw mesh obj to ZBrush, import cleaned/uv unwrapped mesh obj from ZBrush, export cleaned mesh to Agisoft PhotoScan for texture generation.

changelog:

* 0.1.2 import zbrush mask as vertex group
* 0.1.1 first release

***

## [UV Equalize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/2.7x/uv_equalize.py)

Equalizes scale of UVs of selected objects to active object.

* Use when tileable texture needs to be applied on all objects and its scale should be the same across them.
* Available in Object menu of 3d view while in object mode.
* To enable, more than two mesh objects must be selected, one must be active.
* Default behavior is active object determines scale and all other objects will be adjusted. This can be overrided unchecking 'Use Active', then all objects will be averaged.
* Island scale averaging and repacking is optional and will yeld better result.

![UV Equalize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhlik/bpy/master/x/eq2.gif)

[BlenderArtist.org thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?339782-UV-Equalize-and-Tube-Unwrap-addons)

changelog:

* 0.2.3 better fix for bug fixed in previous version..
* 0.2.2 fixed bug which prevented script to work, operators are used for transforming uvs, but when in image editor is loaded 'Render Result', UV will not be displayed and therefore operators will not work.. it's one line fix, just set displayed image to None..
* 0.2.1 auto deselect non mesh objects
* 0.2.0 complete rewrite, now it is pure math
* 0.1.2 fixed different uv names bug
* 0.1.1 uuid windows workaround
* 0.1.0 first release
